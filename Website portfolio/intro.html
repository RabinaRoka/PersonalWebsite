             <h2>About Me</h2>
             <p>I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality. My journey in web development began with curiosity and a desire to build digital experiences that seamlessly blend aesthetics and functionality. As I embarked on this path, I found myself immersed in the dynamic combination of design, coding, and problem-solving that web development demands.
            <br>Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Herald College, Kathmandu, I am fortunate to be a part of an institution affiliated with the esteemed University of Wolverhampton, UK. This academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, setting the stage for my exploration of the ever-evolving field of web development.
            <br>Studying at an institution that adheres to a curriculum associated with a prestigious international university has provided me with access to a varied selection of courses, competent teachers, and a global perspective on technology and its applications. This academic environment has fueled my interest in web development, encouraging me to always push the boundaries of my knowledge and talents.
        </p>
                <h2>My Skills</h2>
                <p>Through dedicated learning and hands-on projects, I've honed my skills in a wide array of web development technologies. From mastering the essentials of HTML and CSS for structuring and styling captivating web interfaces, to utilizing JavaScript for enhancing user engagement and interactivity, I've built a strong foundation in frontend development.My toolkit expands beyond frontend technologies, encompassing backend proficiency in Python and PHP. With Python, I've explored the realm of versatile scripting, automation, and backend logic implementation. Meanwhile, my familiarity with PHP has enabled me to create dynamic and data-driven web applications that cater to diverse user needs.<br>

                Furthermore, I bring design sensibilities into my projects, ensuring that each element is not only functional but also visually appealing. I believe that user-centered design is pivotal in creating delightful digital experiences that resonate with audiences.
                <br>  
                To complement my programming skills, I've also acquired a solid understanding of database management using MySQL. Designing, structuring, and querying databases have become second nature to me, allowing me to develop robust and efficient data-driven applications. </p>
